Forced mining labor in Peru and Bolivia from 1573 to 1812. A couple of *hundred* indigenous communities were made to send 1/7th of their males to mine silver and mercury.

The mita took place at high altitudes, in an exclusively high altitude region, roughly 7000 meters high.

People within the borders of where the Mita took place were consumed significantly less and were much more stunted than outside the borders.

This is the region where Spanish conquerors mined for silver to help with Europe's shitty deficit (related to the holy wars).
