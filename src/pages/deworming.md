The Scope of the Problem:

Over 2 billion people are affected by worms. Worm infections can bring upon multiple symptoms, such as diarrhea and anemia. They can also hinder children's mental and physical development, affecting educational outcomes.

There are different types of worms, and are typically transmitted through poor hygiene and sanitation. Children may come in contact with worms in freshwater or  contaminated soil, and may ingest worms for not having washed their hands. These poor sanitary conditions create externalities that expose others to worms.

Worms don't reproduce, but can buildup through repeated exposure. People can be reinfected. Treatment is cheap -- $0.03 for most variety of worms, and $0.20 for the freshwater variety (schistosomiasis).

1998-2001, International Child Support Africa (ICS) assigns deworming treatment to 75 primary schools (Primary School Deworming program) in the Busia District, Kenya. 45,000 pupils treated.

Outcomes measured were prevalence of worm infection, severity of worm infection (worm loads), self-reported illness, and school outcomes (participation and grades).

25 schools were phased in at a time: group 1 comprised 1998 and 1999, group 2 in 1999, and group 3 2001. In 1998, group 1 was the treatment group, while groups 2 and 3 were the comparison groups (as they were as yet untreated). In 1999, groups 1 and 2 were the treatment group, while group 3 was used as the comparison (group 3 wouldn't be exposed to treatment until 2001).


Review the R stuff (regression etc).
