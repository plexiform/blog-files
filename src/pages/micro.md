<h4>Elasticity</h4>

<h4>Constrained Choice</h4>

<h4>Consumer Theory</h4>

<h5>Deriving the Demand Curve:</h5>
We derive the demand curve by finding optimal bundles along different budget constraints (which are determined by shifting a good's price), and plotting the good's demand (quantity purchased) at those prices. We're solving multiple constrained maximization problems - that is, plotting the same indifference curve along different budget constraints.


<h5>Income Shifts:</h5>
A change in income moves the budget constraint in or out in totality, without changing the price/quantity relationship of a good. Graphing this relationship between income and demand for a good.

Elasticity:
${\gamma} = {\frac {\frac {\Delta Q}{Q}} {\frac {\Delta Y}{Y}}}$

Normal goods have an elasticity of $>0$.
There are two subcategories of normal goods: luxury goods, which have an elasticity of $>1$, and necessities, which have an elasticity of $0 > n > 1$. This means that the proportion spent on luxury goods is higher than the proportion your income went up, whereas the proportion spent on necessities goes down as your income goes up.
Inferior goods have an elasticity of $<0$.

Non-satiation states that people will always want more, so by definition at least some good(s) in a bundle are normal (since with more income, you're buying more). Others in the bundle may be inferior or substituted away from.

<h4>Income and Substitution Effects</h4>

Once a good's price goes up, its budget constraint shifts in or out, and our point of tangency and therefore optimal bundle, changes in response. This change can be decomposed into 2 effects.

**Substitution effect:** Holding utility constant, how much less of a good do you want when its price goes up?

We want to capture *just* the effect of the good being more expensive (and *not* us being effectively poorer for it). Draw a budget constraint *parallel* to the new, shifted-inward budget constraint. We do this because the slope of this budget constraint shows the new trade-off between goods. We then set this parallel budget constraint tangent to the old indifference curve, in order to determine how our trade-offs respond to the good being more expensive. 

Because we're operating on the same indifference curve as before the price change while it's tangent to the new ratio, it means we're simply trading away from the more expensive good to the cheaper good and getting the same total utils.

When the price of the good goes up, the indifference curve is tangent at a point that substitutes away from (i.e. in a negative direction) the good.

AKA the notion of *compensated demand.* Meaning you're being compensated for being that much poorer, with a new budget constraint/ratio.

**Income effect**: Holding price constant, how much less of a good do you want because you're poorer?

<h4>Labor Supply</h4>

Many people treat labor as a bad. Leisure is a normal good, meaning it has an elsticity of greater than 0. So we try to model labor supply in terms of leisure and how much you can afford with not-leisure. Labor is therefore $H = 24-N$, or 24 hours minus how much leisure ($N$) we get. 

The harder you work, the more goods you have but less leisure you have. Therefore, the price of leisure is the wage. Leisure *costs* the wage.

**Negative Income Tax / Negative Impact Experiment**:

Randomly varied how much taxes people paid. Therefore net wage varies. Men's elasticity of labor didn't change much when they paid fewer taxes, whereas women's did.

**Lottery winners**:

Comparing lottery winners against losers. Labor supply of lottery winners work less, but not by much (\$55k average win, worked $1900 less). Because substitution effect wrt labor supply measures the tradeoff or substitution between leisure and labor, and winning the lottery doesn't change the price of leisure or labor, this is pure income effect talking.

**Social Security**:

Insurance against not being able to earn income anymore. About 180 countries have social security systems.

What is the implicit tax on work? Implicit tax is different from FICA, which is the tax taken to fund social security. Instead, implicit tax is the penalty to social security when you work more, or the benefits you give up. Working during a potential social security-insured year, means not getting those social security benefits. This is a tax.

The U.S. has actuarial adjustments to accommodate this tax. These adjustments add 7% per year of social security foregone, for when you do finally take the benefits. This effectively nullifies that implicit tax.

In the Netherlands, social security replaces 90% of your income. This opportunity costs makes the true economic gain of working just 10% of your wage. Then you pay taxes when you work as opposed to not working -- and they have high taxes. The labor market just about empties at age 60. This has caused problems.


<h4>Producer theory:</h4>

For firms,
Variable inputs are Labor (${L}$).
Fixed costs are capital (${K}$).

In the short run,
Firms have fixed costs (capital),
and variable costs (labor)

Total cost = Fixed cost + Variable cost (${TC = FC + VC}$).

Marginal cost is the change in costs as quantity changes (${MC = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta q}}$).

Because in the short run, fixed costs are just that -- they won't change -- Short run marginal costs (${SRMC}$) = ${\frac{\Delta VC}{\Delta q}}$.

Average cost = ${\frac {TC}{q}}$

Marginal cost's relation to average cost:

Average costs tend to dip at first, because at first there are the fixed costs that bring the curve down as quantity increases (the more quantity is produced for that fixed cost, the cheaper it is), and then the marginal costs bring that up (the additional cost of production per quantity).

<h4>Short run cost curves:</h4>

${q = f(L, K)}$

${C = (\overline K \times r) + (L \times w)}$

${L \times w}$ is simply labor hours times wage, whereas ${\overline K \times r}$ is the fixed capital times the rental rate (a per unit cost of renting for a year).


The marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost listed above. K is fixed, so its derivative is 0. Therefore, applying the constant multiple rule, we get


${MC = w \times \frac {\Delta L}{\Delta q}}$ (${\frac {\Delta L}{\Delta q}}$ being the derivative of $L$ w.r.t $q$). This is just the derivative of $VC$, aka the $SRMC$ as, again, the derivative of $FC$ in the total cost $C$ equation was $0$.

Recall that ${MP_\textrm{L} = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta L}}$. This simply means that the marginal product of labor is equal to the change of quantity over change in labor (how much quantity you get per labor unit).

This fact allows us to rewrite the $MC$ as ${MC = w \times \frac {1}{MP_\textrm L}}$. This means that the marginal cost goes down the bigger the marginal product of labor is.

<h4>Long Run Cost Curves</h4>

Since capital is variable in the long run, how does a firm choose its input mix?

We find the tangency between the isocost (analogous to the consumers' budget constraint, representing ${-\frac{w}{r}}$) and the isoquant (the slope of the Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution, or MRTS). This is just the cost minimization part, for some level of $q$.

Next we need to find how to maximize profits.

$MRTS = -\frac{MP_{L}} {MP_{K}} = -\frac{w}{r}$

This is the key efficiency condition. It can be rewritten as $\frac{MP_{L}}{w} = \frac{MP_{K}}{r}$

This is the point at which dollar paid per labor unit is equal to dollar paid per rental (capital) unit.

*Changes in Input Prices:*

Raising the cost, or input prices, of labor or capital has firms substitute away from them. This for example can explain why artificially raising the price of labor (minimum wage) will lower employment rates, as firm shifts from labor to capital. This is the equivalent of a firm's substitution effect.

*Long Run Cost Curve:*

The long run expansion path, or *Long Run cost curve* is the cost minimizing combination of capital and labor for every output (profit) level. This is for different levels of isoquants (subject to the same MRTS).

*Deriving Long Run Cost Curves:*

Firms may know how to minimize costs for a given quantity of production, but how do they decide on that quantity in the first place?

In perfect competition, firms are price takers on both inputs and outputs. This means that A) the demand for the firm's outputs and B) the supply of their inputs are perfectly elastic.

The conditions for A means consumers believe multiple firms in the market sell identical products, that they know the prices of the products, and that it doesn't cost much to switch from one service or product to another.

**Residual Demand:**

$Q(p)$ represents market demand.

$q(p) = Q(p) - S^{\circ}(p)$ represents a firm's demand in the market, where $S^{\circ}$ is the combined supply of all other firms in the market.

[elaborate after review of derivation]

**How do Firms choose their Q?:**

No entry and exit.

Profit is revenues minus cost ($\pi = R - C$). Opportunity costs need be accounted for!

Maximizing $\pi$ means maximizing $\pi(q) = R(q) - C(q)$. This sets Marginal Revenue ($MR$) equal to Marginal Cost ($MC$). In perfectly competitive market, $MR = P$, because firms are price takers and therefore what they make off a product is what the market is willing to pay. Since in the optimum $MR = MC$, $MC = P$.
