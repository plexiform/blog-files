  <h3>“For Gracias, the Tesla and SpaceX investor and Musk’s friend, the 2008 period told him everything he would ever need to know about Musk’s character. He saw a man who arrived in the United States with nothing, who had lost a child, who was being pilloried in the press by reporters and his ex-wife and who verged on having his life’s work destroyed. “He has the ability to work harder and endure more stress than anyone I’ve ever met,” Gracias said. “What he went through in 2008 would have broken anyone else. He didn’t just survive. He kept working and stayed focused.” That ability to stay focused in the midst of a crisis stands as one of Musk’s main advantages over other executives and competitors. “Most people who are under that sort of pressure fray,” Gracias said. “Their decisions go bad. Elon gets hyperrational. He’s still able to make very clear, long-term decisions. The harder it gets, the better he gets. Anyone who saw what he went through firsthand came away with more respect for the guy. I’ve just never seen anything like his ability to take pain.”</h3>

"Failure is not a stigma. If you try hard and it doesn't work out, that's okay. You can learn from that and do another company and it's not a big deal."
<hr/>
Have an exciting future you can look forward to. We need things that make you want to get out of bed in the morning.

"You first have to say, 'What is the goal?' and once you have what is the goal, you can then measure the various designs against that goal."

"People almost invariably arrive at their beliefs not on the basis of proof but on the basis of what they find attractive." - pascal

“‘Tis easier to suppress the first desire, than to satisfy all that follow it.” — Benjamin Franklin
<hr/>
“Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time, who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done, if we are always doing.” - Thomas Jefferson
<hr/>
“The great enemy of foreign language learning is a sense of shame, an inability or unwillingness to become like a child again and let one's inadequacies show.” - herbert simon, models of my life
<hr/>
“We take a handful of sand from the endless landscape of awareness around us and call that handful of sand the world.” - robert pirsig, zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance
<hr/>
“Peace of mind produces right values, right values produce right thoughts. Right thoughts produce right actions and right actions produce work which will be a material reflection for others to see of the serenity at the center of it all.” - robert pirsig, zen
<hr/>
“The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a digital computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of the mountain, or in the petals of a flower. To think otherwise is to demean the Buddha - which is to demean oneself.”
<hr/>
“Anxiety, the next gumption trap, is sort of the opposite of ego. You're so sure you'll do everything wrong you're afraid to do anything at all. Often this, rather than "laziness" is the real reason you find it hard to get started”
<hr/>
“True imagination and creativity don’t come from thinking outside the box or letting ourselves go wild, just as true spontaneity does not come from dancing on a table on the weekend while you remain in your tedious job. They don’t come out of great disruptive moments that break forth from an otherwise ordinary, drab life. They are part and parcel of how we live our every day; all moments can be creative and spontaneous when we experience the entire world as an open and expansive place. We get there by constantly cultivating our ability to imagine transcending our own experience.” - puett, the path
<hr/>
“There is no ethical or moral framework that transcends context and the complexity of human life. All we have is the messy world within which to work and better ourselves. These ordinary as-if rituals are the means by which we imagine new realities over time construct new worlds. Our lives begin in the everyday and stay in the everyday. Only in the everyday can we begin to create truly great worlds.” - path
<hr/>
“People’s beliefs about their abilities have a profound effect on those abilities.”
― Albert Bandura
<hr/>
“The human mind is generative, creative, proactive, and reflective -- not just reactive.”
― Albert Bandura
<hr/>
“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.”

Be not afraid of growing slowly, be afraid only of standing still.
