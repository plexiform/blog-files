What could I have done better?

    - Recognized the need to address the anxiety around certain subjects
      - Used CBT, mindfulness, and self-compassion to address these
      - [I eventually did this, but with little time remaining to study]
      - Built in a longer break for every 3 hours of study, even if the 3 hours 
      comprised shorter breaks in-between
      - [Also did this eventually]
    - Acknowledged lack of prerequisite knowledge and worked with what I could, 
      sooner
        - This was a major takeaway. I can still progress in subject material
          and while bolstering the prerequisite knowledge during another
          time block
There is one exception to Beeminder 8 hours/day rule. It pertains to the unrealistic nature of never having studied more than 3-4 hours a day at a time and then expecting to simply jump to 8.

The rule is that, as I'm *habit shaping* and building stamina up to the intended 8 hours, doing as well or better than the previous day will be sufficient, given that I met the minimum 4 hours. Streaks of having done *as well* can go up to 3 days, at which point I go higher.
