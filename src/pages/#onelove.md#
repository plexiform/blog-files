calc minutes: 222
calc goal: 240
total hours: ~300m (5h)
total goal: >= 480m (-3h - improvements to be found in a) shorter breaks, b) earlier start, c) removing distractions on laptop (start Focustime immediately). Additionally, being realistic about my energy levels pertaining studying, especially after late evening comes around.

Beeminder slack for meeting my record, habit shaping. In addition, for having found direction and needing rest to that end come tomorrow!
