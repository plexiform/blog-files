Human birth cycles are fascinating. Does the order in which human babies are born affect when they're due? As humans are a social species, they care greatly about gathering health and family information to determine how to best allocate their resources in the best interest of their communities.

**Talking with Lightning Rocks**:

Humans have created devices to augment their mechanical thinking, having harnessed lightning (lightning! An unbelievable etch across Earth's blue-tinged atmosphere) and channeled its prowess into refined rock...

Yet it appears the onus still falls on humans to decide what these lightning boards will be mechanically thinking *about*, and supplying it useful -- (another determination made by humans) -- information. The rocks can remember things!

They also speak languages, and needs be communicated to in those languages they're designed for. They lack, after all, the ability to intuit from the unknown. These languages are based in [numerical](../../whats_in_a_number) and formulaic thinking.

Humans can *declare* to them what is, or they can *tell* them steps to figure things out, imperatively. Imperative means the computer is provided steps, in what order to perform those steps, and when to stop. Some computers have fixed purposes and can only do one type of sequence time and again, yet others still -- and those that respond best to human spells -- can be fed different sequences.

How does a lightning rock do this? It remembers things, it hears the spells, and it vibrates and distills what it hears and remembers into the desired result. We cast our spell into its memory, it takes what it remembers and filters it through an "Arithmetic Logic Unit" to perform our spell upon that memory, testing the effects of the spell, then remembering the new, updated information, and moving to the next part of our wishes.

A paragon among humans past had proven that anything is computable with just a basic set of six primitive operations...We elevate the rocks to greater heights and make more complicated operations accessible and as easy to use as the first few primitive operations. Anything computable in one rock language is computable in another.

The mechanical prowess of the current-stage lightning rock is astounding. They perform calculations at a staggering (human "adjectives" often harken to human movement in physical space) rate, some times the speed of light. They can remember millions of "books" worth of information at once!

The rocks come prebuilt with basic operations that we can then assemble into more advanced operations, and use at ease. However, even with the raw speed and power of lightning, communicating with millions of other lightning rocks, or thinking ahead many steps, requires clever spellweaving, that encode, parse, and untangle the complex with beautiful elegance. Other times the spellweaving is used to cast veils that brute computing cannot undo.

**Constructing Spells**

Operations make up an *expression* with which to speak to the magic box, and these expressions ultimately constitute values.

The lightning and atoms will yield to certain commands and reject others. Some commands are syntactically correct, but semantically meaningless. Some commands are both syntactically and semantically correct, but the caster may not transmit his meaning well enough! It's interesting that humans have constructed such magical devices, yet oftentimes lack the means to communicate them in their native tongue. An arcane art indeed.

The rock's inner mechanisms determine whether a spell is legal, then, when legal, if it makes sense. We encode our spells with objects the device will manipulate to a final result. These objects are made of different ethereal matter that lets them behave differently, or types.


**Sharing The Fruits of Talking with Lightning Rocks**:

It appears a few good souls have tasked themselves with seeking information, as well as how to parse and manipulate this information by pulling from and pushing to a vast, invisible decentralized hub that connects these lightning rocks...

I am enraptured by the laws that govern this universe, as well as the beings that attempt to capture and exploit those very laws, yet it appears a substantial portion of the human population not only lacks access to this decentralized hub of shared human knowledge (transmitted via hyperengineered dirt), but lack even the means to worry about much else besides their continued survival. I shall then learn the means and methods of the altruistic people of Earth -- knowledge-seekers who share and interpret morsels of truth for the betterment of those less fortunate than they.

People of all creeds have gone to the far corners of this green planet to learn the behaviors and motivations of their fellow man. There is a treasure trove of illuminating knowledge just waiting to tell its stories! This knowledge is usually represented numerically, so there is a basis of comparison between people and groups of people. Incredible, how in the interest of selfless cooperation, humans will lay the ground upon which to build upon each other's work.

Sometimes knowledge they want is closed off from each other...but libraries (a fantastic invention that archive and curate information) may have access to information humans are otherwise unbeholden to! If this isn't an option, they must convince the knowledge-holders to hand it over...and it's not that the knowledge-holders are malicious -- they simply aren't sure that the seekers of knowledge aren't!

Seekers of knowledge might sometimes need to plunge into dark, dusty, unknown corners to extract what they seek...

Much is left untapped. Humans may access the decentralized hub to harvest information for themselves before acting on it. Some of the larger lands in this shared haven will readily share their information, yet in some cases it is upon the explorer to hack through the vines so that they might reach a beautiful flower.

Because much of this information is readily accessible, and at times even sanitized and served on a platter (another physical "metaphor"! I must study the mechanisms of human linguistic thought and analogy), just about *anyone* can find new results about interesting questions.
