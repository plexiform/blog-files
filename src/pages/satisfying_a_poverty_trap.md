Deaton and Dreze measured elasticity of nutrition relative to expenditure. They found that as time passed, people with the same incomes would spend less overall on food. What for? New goods introduced? Other factors? They also found that in a single given time frame, richer houses consumed more calories.

The difficulty with their assessment is we're observing things sort of after the fact without any intervention. Who knows why people spend less overall on food in the same income bracket, for example.


These factors could be endogenous to the people in question.

GiveDirectly wanted to introduce exogenous variables (cash transfers) to determine the effect of more money on expenditure and nutritional elasticity. They did find that on average, people who received the transfer consumed about 20% more overall.

The GiveDirectly program sent out enumerators to collect census data and to determine which villagers should be eligible for the program. They went off of what types of roofs people had -- thatched or iron -- under the assumption that thatched roofs covered poorer people.

The program randomized on two levels: at the village level, and the household level. This was done so they could measure spillover effects. If someone gets a cash transfer through Kenya's M-Pesa service, they might help -- or upset -- their neighbors. First they compared across villages, then they compared treated households to spillover households (i.e. the other houses in the village).

The spillover measurement was a comparison between spillover households in treated villages, and the untreated households in control villages.

Elasticity from the GiveDirectly program was measured to be about 0.8 (expenditure on nutrition). Increase in food expenditure was \$20, whereas control food expenditure was \$104. Increase in overall expenditure was \$36, while control in overall expenditure was \$157.

This is the measure of elasticity of income to nutrition.

Elasticity is measured as change in food expenditure over original food expenditure, over change in overall expenditure divided by original expenditure.

However, we're assuming that all food expenditure was calorie-inclined, when in actuality there was also a substitution effect, as shown by purchases of Meat and fish having an elasticity of 2 (10% increase in income means 20% increase in meat and fish). So we're upwardly biased.

In order to satisfy the conditions of a poverty trap, we need the [elasticity of income to nutrition] times [elasticity of nutrition to productivity] to be greater than 1. The first term is thus not satisfied, so the second term would need to make up the difference.

Now we need a measure of nutrition to productivity. Cue Wolgemuth's study on Kenyan road workers.

Wolgemuth gave bowls of porridge to Kenyan road workers.


There were two groups. He gave group 1 a bowl of porridge of about 200 kcal, 7 grams of protein, and 1.36 mg of iron.


Group 2 received 1000 kcal, 7g protein, and 2.18mg iron.


Having followed the groups to observe what they eat on the job and at home, they found that group 1 consumed a net positive of about 69 calories, whereas for group 2 it was 549.

The increase for males was at about 23%, and the increase in productivity at 12.5%. ${\frac {12.5}{23} \approx 0.54}$ as the elasticity of nutrition to productivity.

Taking the elasticity of income to nutrition, and nutrition to productivity, we get ${.54 \times .83 = .45}$, and again, this being an upward estimate as Deaton approximated that roughly half of the income-nutrition relationship was more substituting to *more expensive* calories, as opposed to simply consuming *more* calories.

These two studies don't support much the existence of a nutrition-based poverty trap.
