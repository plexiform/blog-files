title: "Surf the urge"

Went to a concert after 5 and was out for most of the evening.


    - During liminal moments, surf the urge (wait 10 minutes to see if I still want to do the thing)
    - implement 2 minute rule - TIC/TOC
    - Start sooner in the time blocks so as to make the most of them
    - Start teaching in blog posts (implement tags)

Time blocked | Planned time        | What I did                                                                                  | Actual time

breaks and liminal moments included [reasonably] a nap, lunch, etc, and [unreasonably] browsing urges that turned 5m breaks into 20m breaks
