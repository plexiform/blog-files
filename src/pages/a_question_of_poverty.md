World Development index, 2004 - 2014:

Mean GDP per capita in this dataset was $12,967.
The mean illiteracy rates overall were about 18%, but female's illiteracy rates (~21%) were 33% higher than males (~14%).

Overall, the infant mortality rate is 25%.

Of this group, the average illiteracy rates for the 50 richest countries is 4.19%. The lowest *.29%*, whereas the highest of the 50 is at 10%.

Compare this to the poorest 50 countries, whose mean illiteracy rate is 40.59%, and their highest is 84.54%. Interestingly enough, the lowest illiteracy rate in these poorest 50 countries is .26%, in Georgia.

Infant mortality rates in the 50 richest countries average about 4%, at a maximum of 13%.

Here we can see who counterbalances that 4%, with the poorest 50 countries averaging a 54% infant mortality rate, the lowest of which is about 20%.

As if it's not obvious enough, running a regression shows that GDP per capita is negatively correlated with infant mortality. The same goes for illiteracy.
