Just an hour of work done at the right tail-end of the day. I won't up my counter for this, but I won't reset it either, because I am off to a fire start. I got 24 hours of studying done last week. If I do better than that this week, I'm contented.

This is a crucial reminder that taking care of my mental health will be right up there with my physical health. It's time to establish these habits -- including that of journaling, as I'm doing here -- without letting them fall to the wayside.
