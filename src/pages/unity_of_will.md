My aim is to preserve what we're losing, regain what we've lost, and optimize the rest.

In emerging economies, I'll design markets that empower people and promote innovation.

Towards climate change, I'll model energy systems to reduce waste.

On online platforms, I'll share cultural tales through data viz and oral storytelling, and the science of cooking.

Fun algorithmic game model demonstrations??
