I'd spent years running away from my strengths and inclinations. I know better now. 
My strengths as measured by the VIA Institute are listed below, measured 2 years apart.

Note that even my lowest and median scores on the newer report would figure near the top on my older report.

The common denominators are <i> appreciation of beauty and excellence, hope, love of learning, perspective,</i> and <i>leadership</i>. That incites some cognitive dissonance given how many of my interactions figured online, so one of my goals is to bridge the gap between my social skills online and face-to-face interactions.

I'm still getting used to Rescuetime, and will tweak its settings such that the productivity pulse is  more representative of my values.

***Rescuetime daily report for January 13th, 2020, scaled from -1 for least productive to 2 for very productive:***

Rank |	Time Spent (HH:MM:SS) |	Productivity
---  |--- | --- | ---
1  |	04:47:20  |	2
2  |	00:28:05  |	0
3  |	00:20:26  |	-2
4  |  00:01:34  |	1 
5  |	00:00:51  |  -1

Not bad!
