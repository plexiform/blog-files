- Write about the models in plain English

Models:

- land redistribution, limited liability constraints, maximizing effort and output
  - meaning: providing farmers a baseline of security for their wellbeing, and increasing their bargaining power
- credit, cost of fixed monitoring
- corruption, government paying rents to have the corrupt work there
- roads in Indonesia; taring for comparison
- fertilizer and quasi-hyperbolic discounting; lockboxes
- savings, compound interest, and mutual insurance
- more specifically on mutual insurance: different models, optimism and trust
- nutrition-based poverty traps (45 degree line)
- geography as it pertains to health and economic outcomes; persistent effects of damaged institutions and relations
- education (parents' expectations)
- Paxson rainfall model
- modeling consumption smoothing/Euler equation

<h3>themes:</h3>

- perspectives in the developed vs developing world (gender, risk, insurance)
- faith (bhopas, quranic readings)
- gender and sexism
- scarcity and decision-making
- rents in corruption and exploitation
- the role of geography and climate

<MyPop notes="source this; in particular, the 2% figure" edits="Letting the subject and verb lead; emphatic words for the beginning and end of both sentences and paragraph. Perhaps tie their 'walking' with barefoot hedge managers">The Asian Contagion of ’97 decimated the thai baht, ensnared progress in the Philippines, and torpedoed banks to bailouts. Yet the same financial crisis explained just 2% of the the poor's variation in household income. Indonesian rice farmers – and peddlers of traded goods in general – ended up <i>richer</i>. When the global economy tumbles, the penniless trudge on.</MyPop>

rationality vs faith vs we're only human

- scarcity/stress-based decision making (refer to bamboo harvest study)
- as with people everywhere, present-bias (quasi-hyperbolic fertilizer; tying odysseus to the mast; euler's equation)
- lack of regulation and information: vaccines, insurance

Contrast this with people with fixed incomes, such as government employees. They were worst off, as indicated by their increased attendance of Quranic reading classes. They resorted to faith whereas rice farmers hadn't (these were less likely to attend such classes). This is similar to the poorest in West Bengal, who, when lacking resources to get expensive medical care, attend their bhopas instead of qualified doctors.

The poor are more likely to attend their witch doctors for the expensive ailments <b>citation needed</b>

Pascaline Dupas and Jonathan Robinson tested how opening bank accounts for savings-constrained Kenyan business owners affected their activities and expenditures. With a $7 opening fee, hefty withdrawal fees, and no interest, the accounts weren't particularly good. D&R randomly opened accounts for these business owners, who ended up more resilient to shocks and increased their business investments. Why is this, when there's no interest? D&R postulate this is because simply having a place to set away their money allows business owners to build a buffer against potential shocks. This is another benefit to formal institutions. It should be noted however that a significant portion of people still abstained from using their accounts at all.

There are other forms of savings that people don't undertake. One example of savings is abstaining from using credit to buy from fruit or tea vendors in Chennai. These vendors charge 5% interest, which over time would compound substantially. Potential customers could opt to save by not spending some amount of what they buy with credit, therefore saving on that interest, effectively increasing their income. If they make a similar decision day after day, their income will have increased to the point that they don't need to spend or borrow nearly as much as they were at the beginning. So why don't they do this?

One possible explanation is that these customers don't understand compounding interest. Perhaps they have poor self-control, or discount the future too heavily. Professor Banerjee discounts this discounting theory, since if people were that impatient, we'd see that impatience manifest in some rather obvious ways across their lives; however, we don't see people just selling their houses and throwing end-of-the-world parties. People seem to behave as if their future matters. Other reasons include wanting to maintain their relationships with their vendors, lacking access to savings, or being involved in family conflict that undermines their saving.

One experiment attempts to ascertain what's really going on. This experiment buys out its participants' debts, then has these participants undergo financial literacy training. The hypotheses include potentially increased savings or at least a steady state of money sans shocks, or, if the issues are internal, such as with self-control, quick relapse into debt.

In both the Philippines and India, the training don't do squat. Or it does half-squat. About half the people plunge back into debt, but the others don't. Those that fall back into debt don't fall at rates that would suggest a 5% interest rate. Instead, it seems people stay at a certain amount of money until they fall into debt due to some circumstance or another, and then stay at that level of debt. This suggests impatience and an unwillingness to take advantage of compound interest.

If we're going to understand this impatience, we can begin to sketch the problem with hyperbolic discounting. u(c_1) + \beta\delta u(c_2) + \beta\delta^2u(c_3) $, or $\max u(c_1) + \beta[u(c_2) + \delta u(c_3)].

u(c_1)u(c
1
​
 ) is how much we value today's consumption, u(c_2)u(c
2
​
 ) is how much we value tomorrow's, and u(c_3)u(c
3
​
 ) is how much we value the day after's. Each successive period is discounted by a constant \betaβ, and a power of \deltaδ that indicates how much less we value time further away from us.

In the sketch above, the individual values period 1 over period 2 by a factor of \beta\deltaβδ, and period 2 over period 3 by \deltaδ. The issue, however, is that when they move into the future, suddenly "tomorrow" is now "today," and it's worth that much more. Their preferences are time inconsistent. If this is the case, people will want to use commitment devices to tie their hands.

To test this, a Philippine microfinance institution offered savings accounts with built-in commitment features, meaning the clients can't withdraw (Tying Odysseus to the Mast by Ashraf et al.). The withdrawal mechanism is either time- or money-based, where in either case clients can withdraw once they've waited long enough or saved long enough. They were given the additional choice to place their savings in a lockbox that the bank had the key to. Participants' discount preferences were measured at baseline. The hypothesis is that hyperbolic discounters, or time inconsistent people, who are aware of their bias, demand commitment.

In the end, half of the people contributed to their accounts. Far more people chose the time goal than the amount goal, though those who chose the amount goal saved much more. No one tried to withdrsaw prematurely. Of these, do the hyperbolic discounters take up the commitment device? An indicator of hyperbolic discounting is whether the people reverse their preferences, i.e. choosing today over tomorrow, but the day-after-tomorrow over tomorrow. Preference reversal predicted commitment device takeup for women but not for men. When they incommit, they save more.

tragedy of the commons:
- cow tongue insurance market ?
- bulls sold and resold
- wages in drought years (seema jayachandran)
- in contrast: independence of risk for farmers (Townsend in Yang Pien, Thailand), and pros of diversification
-

It turns out that people use bullocks as savings. The same applies to bricks and housing, except these are less liquid than bullocks. Despite that, bullocks aren't entirely liquid, since their demand depends on rainfall and crop condition. When the crop is good, people have more money that they can then spend on bullocks -- which are expensive, since they're supply-constrained given that everyone is trying to buy them. Conversely, when shit's hit the fan, everyone tries to dump their assets and prices plummet. Thus, people buy when bull prices are high and sell when prices are low. The shared environment therefore produces a highly ineffective market.

People might work more to mitigate risk. However, if they're working more due to a storm or drought, chancces are their neighbors are too. This lowers their wages and thus fucks them further. Seema Jayachandran examines this hypothesis. SShe looks at wages in drought years versus non-drought years; in addition, she examines to what extent banking services attenuate the effects of drought on wages.

Her results show first that, as we'd expect, your agricultural yield is good for your agricultural wage. She then goes to show that by any measure of banking (number of deposits, bank credits owed, or amount of branches in the area), wage is less affected by yield when we have banking. But if we're in a place with fewer banks, we'll more likely to sell our labor for cheap.

- temperature on performance
- malaria (tropical climates)

Paxson wanted to find out how much people saved out of transitory income. This can be confounding given how datasets are usually presented, with only savings and income and no other labeled variables. Income and savings by themselves don't tell us how much of the savings are coming out of permanent income versus temporary income.

We can't just look at how much people make and say, “They save this much more when they make $1 more.” There might be some third variable that's affecting both how much people save and make. For example, perhaps you're just a more industrious individual. There might also be some effect of savings on income, i.e. the correlation goes both ways. Sure, if you make more, you might save more; but you also might choose to save less, or if you save more, you might choose not to maake more.

In order to negotiate these issues, Paxson observes deviations from average rainfall as a proxy for transitory income. Because of the problems mentioned above re: regressing savings on total income, she needed to decompose total income into its aggregate parts. She does the same with permanent income — that is, account for traits such as age and land owned that are likely indicators of permanent income. After regressing income on transitory and permanent indicators, she takes their \betaβ's. She regresses savings on them, along with a residual term for unexplained sources of income and how they feed into savings, and predicts if the coefficient for temporary income on savings is larger than the coefficient for permanent income on savings.

She finds that indeed, people save much more out of their temporary incomes than their permanent incomes.

Observe variations in temperature in country over time, controlling for region and time effects; correlation goes one way since we can't influence temperature in a short span of time but temperature can effect us; +1deg C = 1.3-1.4% lower growth that year, less when additional factors controlled for; poorer agriculture, higher risk of political instability <b>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dell/files/aej_temperature.pdf</b>

roads as networks
- colonization of africa
- distance from places, china
- haciendas (mita)
- radio transmission of brazilian voting results

Melissa Dell notes that the *mita* choked the development of roads such that areas within the catchment area were poorly connected. Also, the creation of *haciendas* was strongly restricted within the geographical bounds of the *mita*. Roads were created because the hacienda's landed elite lobbied for better infrastructure. These roads are useful for commerce and trade to this day. The residual effects of [not] establishing haciendas persist as well. These include protection for the peasantry residing within, as they weren't conscripted to work within the mita's catchment. When the communal land tenure of the mita was lifted, peasants within the catchment area weren't granted any land.
