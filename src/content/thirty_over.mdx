Dave Cutler
While Cutler began applications programming 1 year out of university, at the age of 23, he didn't begin working on operating systems until the age of 29. For the next 4 years he developed operating systems for the PDP-11, which established his reputation. At the age of 33, he was recruited to DEC, where he and 4 others spearheaded work on the VMS operating system.

Paul Graham
Graham started Viaweb at the age of 31/32, and IIRC was pulling code all-nighters at the age of 29 or so.

Stephen Deering
Deering received his B.Sc. in 1973. I don't know how old he was at the time, but he received his M.Sc. 9 years later in 1982, and his PhD in 1991 -- another 9 years later. He worked at Xerox PARC from 1990-1996. The IPv6 protocol he pioneered was introduced in 1995. So even if Deering was a prodigy and received his B.Sc. at the age of, say, 14, he would've been around 32 by the time he got his PhD and began working at PARC. If he graduated at 22-23 like most, he'd have been around 40 at the time of his breakthrough work. A Google search reveals the latter to be the case. B.Sc. at 22, M.Sc. at 30-31, PhD at 40.

John Ellenby
Discovered computers early 20's, did some programming and lecture work with them in his early 20's as well, became involved with Xerox in his 30's, and at the age of 38 founded Grid Systems Corporation w/ others from PARC.

John Cocke
Born 1925. Graduated B.Sc. at 21, PhD at 31. Notable contributions include the CYK algorithm (1961) and the IBM 801 minicomputer (sometime during the '70's, during or after his mid-40's).

Anita Borg
Major work after her PhD, which she obtained at 32.

Stuart Firestein
Began after 30, grad degree 40.

george stephenson
father of railroads; started at or after 30

Marie-France Sagot

Education
1991 BSc in Computer Science, University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil
1993 Master in Computer Science, University of Paris 7, France
1996 PhD in Theoretical Computer Science, University of Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée, France
2000 Habilitation à Diriger les Recherches (HDR), University of Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée, France

Started her PhD in '96 at age 38, meaning she got her MSc at 35 and her BSc at 33

"Marie-France Sagot is director of research at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA) and a member of staff at Claude Bernard University Lyon 1[2][3][4] where she works on algorithms for computational biology[1] and gene prediction[5] and biological sequence analysis.[6] She was elected a Fellow of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) in 2019 for “outstanding contributions to the fields of computational biology and bioinformatics”.[7] Since 2002 she has been a visiting research fellow at King's College London.[4]"

Julius Axelrod

lab and tech work, assistant work during mid-early (after 23), but got his masters of science at 29 and did most of his research with that; PhD at 42
