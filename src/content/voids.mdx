Many people struggle when they first encounter negative numbers in their schooling. It's not something that comes so naturally to us, and an absence of things, a void, *not* doing something, is easy to ignore out of hand. I'd like to give the invisible a more corporeal form – to find the positives in the negatives.

Power doesn't have to be showy. While it can be expressed directly, as lightning to a rod, it can also be expressed indirectly, as freeing up your schedule. How is that? Consider your free schedule. Time that was previously occupied is now available. Maybe that's enough by itself. You've gained mental space and ground in your pursuit of happiness. Or maybe you reinvest that time towards building a friendship or a skillset. So, to me, power is the *potential* to exert influence, starting from our selves and extending outwards. Someone else might have used their power to free up your schedule, but your power increased in turn.

Given this, it's clear that society has empowered so many of us through systems that we fail to notice. We're empowered by the choices that we don't have to make. Our instincts and intuition often fail us – it's natural to want to flail in a riptide, though it's best to stay still. Areas such as "nudge theory" explore ways to achieve a desired behavior through suggestion and reinforcement.

Fruit and vegetable vendors in India often borrow roughly 1000 rupees, or ~$20, a day, at a daily interest rate of 10%. This suggests that they're generating revenues of at least 10% in order to pay their loans back. If they were to set aside just $0.02, or just the cost of a cup of tea, a day, they could accrue interest on that money and borrow less the next day. Using this approach, they could stop borrowing altogether in just a couple of months. [citation]

The below is experiments around this/potential solutions; however, stay on point! The thing is making the invisible, visible

So why don't the poor do this? The prevailing wisdom is that the poor lack either knowledge or patience.


One experiment attempts to ascertain what's really going on. This experiment buys out its participants' debts, then has these participants undergo financial literacy training. The hypotheses include potentially increased savings or at least a steady state of money sans shocks, or, if the issues are internal, such as with self-control, quick relapse into debt. [citation!!!]

In both the Philippines and India, the training don't do squat. Or it does half-squat. About half the people plunge back into debt, but the others don't. Those that fall back into debt don't fall at rates that would suggest a 5% interest rate. Instead, it seems people stay at a certain amount of money until they fall into debt due to some circumstance or another, and then stay at that level of debt. This suggests impatience and an unwillingness to take advantage of compound interest. [citation!!!]

We can model time-inconsistent preferences hyperbolic discounting ($u(c_1) + \beta\delta u(c_2) + \beta\delta^2u(c_3)$, or $\max u(c_1) + \beta[u(c_2) + \delta u(c_3)]$.)

In the sketch above, the individual values period 1 over period 2 by a factor of $\beta\delta$, and period 2 over period 3 by $\delta$. The issue, however, is that when they move into the future, suddenly "tomorrow" is now "today," and it's worth that much more. Their preferences are time inconsistent. If this is the case, people will want to use commitment devices to tie their hands. [!!! REVIEW ILLUSTRATION OF TIME INCONSISTENCY IN MICROECON]

To test this, a Philippine microfinance institution offered savings accounts with built-in commitment features, meaning the clients can't withdraw (Tying Odysseus to the Mast by Ashraf et al.). The withdrawal mechanism is either time- or money-based, where in either case clients can withdraw once they've waited long enough or saved long enough. They were given the additional choice to place their savings in a lockbox that the bank had the key to. Participants' discount preferences were measured at baseline. The hypothesis is that hyperbolic discounters, or time inconsistent people, who are aware of their bias, demand commitment.
[add popup with ashraf table][and citation]

In the end, half of the people contributed to their accounts. Far more people chose the time goal than the amount goal, though those who chose the amount goal saved much more. No one tried to withdrsaw prematurely. Of these, do the hyperbolic discounters take up the commitment device? An indicator of hyperbolic discounting is whether the people reverse their preferences, i.e. choosing today over tomorrow, but the day-after-tomorrow over tomorrow. Preference reversal predicted commitment device takeup for women but not for men. When they commit, they save more.

Opportunity cost is defined as, given the choice you make, the cost of the next-best alternative. Any time you make a choice, you're giving up another. Of course, we don't always know what's best.

In *Breaking Bread with the Dead*, Alan Jacobs says, “…we all need better strategies for making decisions, because the *defaults* we have inherited have costs that we are rarely aware of… Just as our word-processing program gives us a default font that we might not have the energy to change, and a digital thermostat offers preset temperatures that we might not be sure how to change, our social media feeds assume that we will be interested in. . .what everyone else is interested in," [worth noting Michael Jordan's talks on this matter], "which will surely be something that happened today. We may not know we *can* change the default settings of  the media machine; we may know but lack the time and energy to do so. And so those settings continue to *reinforce* the presentism that they're claiming merely to *reflect*.”

The central premise of his book is that we can ground ourselves in this world of constant flux, by wrangling with the past. Perspective yields new insights. Eno [?] and co.[?], architects of the Clock of the Long Now, claim that change operates in a hierarchy. It snaps forth at breakneck speeds at the [media?] level, slows at...

Jacobs continued to say, "By reading and considering the past, we cut through the thick, strong vines that bind our attention to the things of the moment. Our attention thereby becomes more free."

A neat tying-together of both compound interest and of default options is registering for a 401k.
