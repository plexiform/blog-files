[empower definition here]

Power doesn't have to be showy. While it can be expressed directly, as lightning to a rod, it can also be expressed indirectly, as freeing up your schedule. How is that? Consider your free schedule. Time that was previously occupied is now available. Maybe that's enough by itself. You've gained mental space and ground in your pursuit of happiness. Or maybe you reinvest that time towards building a friendship or a skillset. So, to me, power is the *potential* to exert influence, starting from our selves and extending outwards. Someone else might have used their power to free up your schedule, but your power increased in turn.

Given this, it's clear that society has empowered so many of us through systems that we fail to notice. We're empowered by the choices that we don't have to make. Our instincts and intuition often fail us – it's natural to want to flail in a riptide, though it's best to stay still. Areas such as "nudge theory" explore ways to achieve a desired behavior through suggestion and reinforcement.

Fruit and vegetable vendors in India often borrow roughly 1000 rupees, or ~$20, a day, at a daily interest rate of 10%. This suggests that they're generating revenues of at least 10% in order to pay their loans back. If they were to set aside just $0.02, or just the cost of a cup of tea, a day, they could accrue interest on that money and borrow less the next day. Using this approach, they could stop borrowing altogether in just a couple of months. [citation]

The below is experiments around this/potential solutions; however, stay on point! The thing is making the invisible, visible

So why don't the poor do this? The prevailing wisdom is that the poor lack either knowledge or patience.

Opportunity cost is defined as, given the choice you make, the cost of the next-best alternative. Any time you make a choice, you're giving up another. Of course, we don't always know what's best.

In *Breaking Bread with the Dead*, Alan Jacobs says, “…we all need better strategies for making decisions, because the *defaults* we have inherited have costs that we are rarely aware of… Just as our word-processing program gives us a default font that we might not have the energy to change, and a digital thermostat offers preset temperatures that we might not be sure how to change, our social media feeds assume that we will be interested in. . .what everyone else is interested in," [worth noting Michael Jordan's talks on this matter], "which will surely be something that happened today. We may not know we *can* change the default settings of  the media machine; we may know but lack the time and energy to do so. And so those settings continue to *reinforce* the presentism that they're claiming merely to *reflect*.”

The central premise of his book is that we can ground ourselves in this world of constant flux, by wrangling with the past. Perspective yields new insights. Eno [?] and co.[?], architects of the Clock of the Long Now, claim that change operates in a hierarchy. It snaps forth at breakneck speeds at the [media?] level, slows at...

Jacobs continued to say, "By reading and considering the past, we cut through the thick, strong vines that bind our attention to the things of the moment. Our attention thereby becomes more free."

A neat tying-together of both compound interest and of default options is registering for a 401k.
