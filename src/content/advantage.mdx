parents' perception of education -> robbing people of agency and power


This post is about vacuums.

An efficient algorithm can save a fortune on electricity. And climate change. (*elaborate*)

A monopolist will produce their profit-maximizing quantity and mark it up as much as possible. A cartel will achieve identical results through cooperation between firms. Instead of the firms dealing with consumers switching to their competition, they come to an agreement on where to set their price. Yet if one firm dishonors that very agreement, they can exploit the cartel to generate even more profit.

ADD SLIDERS FOR PEOPLE COMPETING ON PRICES AND QUANTITY

*(review firms entering, increasing elasticity of demand, lowering pricess; barriers to entry (physical or otherwise), information asymmetries) vvvvv*

As firms enter a market, they make the market (less elastic? review)

The district head of Udaipur, India partnered with NGO Seva Mandir to reduce nurse absenteeism, which was over 50%. By stationing a head nurse every Monday and having nurses stamp their times under threat of penalty, nurse attendance increased drastically – at first. Eventually, however, attendance rates plummeted to what they were before. Exempt days went up, presumably because the nurses were given slack by supervisors. The trend continued until nurse absenteeism was *higher* than in the control group. They'd learned their limits were even more lax than they'd previously assumed and exercised their freedom accordingly. They gained leisure while making every bit as much as they did before.

Or consider the perspective of corrupt enforcers, described by Becker and Stigler. The enforcers join an organization and have some probability $p$ of getting detected. If they get detected, they'll get their outside option – say $o$. If they *don't* get detected, they get their wage, $w$, and *also* their bribe, $b$. In order for them to be corrupt, they should derive at least as much utility from taking the bribe as from getting paid a normal wage (sans bribe). Their bribe, then, takes the form of $w = po + (1-p)(b+w)$. The difference between their wage and their outside option is the value they derive from being corrupt. Rearranging the preceding formula, we get $w-v = \frac{1-p}{p}b$. They get $\frac{1-p}{p}b$ wealth from being corrupt. One approach to dealing with this is charging the corrupt a rent worth exactly that much. If $w-v < \frac{1-p}{p}b$, then the bribe is worth more than what they stand to gain from work.

*(fill in some math here; also cost of monitoring)*

This means that the more people that are corrupt, the more likely that'll draw corrupt people. The solution then is to cross below $w-v$ so the corruption equilibrium arrives at $0$.

*(leads to roads and radios, i.e. propagation of knowledge)*
