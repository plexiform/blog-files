For over a decade now, I've run into, time and again, rationalists. I began noticing this after joining the DnB mailing list, which led to g's FAQ. G just seemed so knowledgable and so willing to divorce fact from feeling. A quick Google stalk probably then brought me to LessWrong, which thankfully I [mostly] steered clear of. 

Why am I thankful? Because I was an insecure, self-absorbed child bent on being better than others – on sating some deep-seated desire for a validation I'd been denied growing up. That's why I joined that mailing list. The world hails genius. Geniuses are smart. Why not get smarter? Yes, we could all benefit from bettering our ability to navigate the world, but I wasn't after self-reliance nor self-satisfaction nor a challenge, but recognition. Specifically, a recognition that couldn't be attributed to luck nor to looks. One that I, ever the nurture-ist, could own.

As LessWrong was an offshoot for Overcoming Bias, many more organizations and communities have sprouted out of LW. Effective altruists, CFAR, people collaborating with universities' behavioral economics departments.. My gut tells me that most of this community's members started off as I did. Surely their reasons are multifarious, but I'm guessing boil down to a dissatisfaction with their ability to make a decision, and, if made, the ability to act on it.

There's nothing wrong with that. The universe is chaotic. Anxiety abides. Except for when it stunts us. Then, *fix* it, so you might eek out as many productive hours from your life before you end it.

And it's had so many amazing outcomes, hasn't it? Being willing to examine your own biases, to subject your beliefs to scrutiny and maximize your skills' leverage, benefits all. 80,000 Hours urges you to choose a high-impact, high-leverage career. LW-adjacent folks work with philanthropies that run on our soundest science. Placing an order on Amazon prompted us to make the most cost-effective donations for preventing malaria.

Start a company. IPO. Donate to NGO's in Sub-Saharan Africa. It's a trauma that depressed NEET's and Bay Area tiger kids share. If you're not maximizing outcomes, you're being shamed by the media's narrative – provided you're privileged enough to while away the day seeking a definitive Guide to Life on your website of choice (something philosopreneurs share with Joe Rogan bros). You can also choose instead to rebel against society and lambaste the beneficiaries and paragons of our 21st century ideal.

It's weird. This article will be updated as I feel like it, but really all I'm saying is that while I care for excellence, clear thinking, and the pursuit of the truth, I also care for the beauty of a well-wrought poem, of beauty that seizes the heart, and of the colors you must see when you're lost in a rainforest or walking the steppe. Is this dichotomy real? It must be. Everything is so damn intellectualized. 

Answer me this: is the sky as big as it is blue?
