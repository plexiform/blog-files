Each ~30m block represents what I'd done at some point after sitting down for a designated time block, though one block reached *did* reach two pomodoros. Ideally each block will fit 3-4 pomodoros each. Had I done that here, I would have done twice as many pomodoros. However, as this was my first day in establishing a routine, the primary objectives were a) showing up and b) eliminating the friction I'd come to associate with the subjects I'm studying. It turns out they're fascinating! I'm so ready to own these subjects entirely -- to understand how economies reflect people and cultures; how policymaking moves nations for better or for worse. I'm also excited to harness the power concentrated in analyzing, visualizing, and sharing data.

What could I have done better?

    - Sectioned off time to write on the subjects and explicate their beauty
    - Started right away once sitting down for the work at hand
    - Have more effectively blocked websites; kept desktop unplugged
    - more specific subject designation for time logged
    - break away from oversocializing, before it's too late to get anything done

Today was a good day for priming my habits. I set up my workflow and routine, and showed up for the tasks I'd set out for myself in the morning. I did, however, get distracted during the beginning portions of each time block -- one of which was dedicated to this website. Fine. However, I decided to unplug my desktop to prevent myself from being sidetracked as I was at around 3 to 4 PM, followed by a nap. I'd effectively lost an hour.
