Writing tool: 


Declarative vs Imperative knowledge:
declarative = fact
imperative = procedure; a recipe

Fixed vs stored programs.
    Stored: "load into," has an interpreter. Control unit counts; arithmetic logic unit; tests (true or false)


Turing complete - anything computable in one language computable in another; only need a few primitives to compute *anything*

syntactically vs semantically valid

scalar (can't be divided) vs non-scalar
scalar: int, float, bool, nonetype

```python

hi

```
$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $
