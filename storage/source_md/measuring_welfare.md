How do we conduct short surveys to capture rich data?

Proxies for well-being and welfare include consumption, asking people how they are (which can reveal a lot of things indirectly), rights, environment, physical and mental health. We want to be able to measure similar traits across groups and under different policies.

When measuring consumption, we need to account for differences in variability of consumption. More variation can indicate higher anxiety for people. In developing countries, consumption is often easier to measure than income.

It can be useful to distinguish between consumption and consumption expenditure. You can spend a lot on something you won't consume right away, such as a bulk purchase. This can hint at additional factors at play, such as attempting to smooth consumption in case of variance in the future, and give useful insight on people's welfare. Farmers might consume plenty that they grow themselves, yet not measure what they grow themselves as an expenditure.

Food Items:

- food purchased at the market
- food that is produced at home, the value of which can be imputed
- food as gifts, dowries, festivals
- food from employers

Non-food items:

*frequently consumed*:
- resources such as fuel and electricity
- transport

*non-frequently consumed*:
(require longer recall period)

- education
- health
- clothing

When interviewing people on non-frequent items, time frame matters.

Durables, defined as buy-once, use-long:

We can think of durables in terms of their depreciation, or for how long you consume it relative to what it cost.


**Measurement Error:**

Gotta clarify what people mean when surveyed, the units they use, when they're talking about. We can ask them through a simple survey, or have them tote around diaries. Remember that it's important to account for the investment we're asking our respondents to undertake, and the potential dropoff that can cause. Even enumerators' time might be limited.

Recall period means a specific period of time, whereas reference period means some period of time that falls under a subjective label like "a good week," "last month," "typical day," etc.

Asking about recall periods is subject to psychological bias and errors in memory.


**Level of Detail:**

How do we choose which trade-offs to make? It was found in El Salvador by Jolliff, 2001 that mean per capita conssumption is 31% higher when given a full and detailed survey.

Collapsed vs subset modules.

Beegle et al. (2011) in Tanzania found that subset modules performed better than collapsed modules, by comparing both results to the longer-list modules.

Natali and Neubourg (2014) in Bangladesh found the two modules fared similarly, but without a comparison to any long module.

We usually want preexisting data to compare to.
