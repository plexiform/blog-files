Banks don't want to spend 15 cents to store your 20 cents.

The government of India mandated that everyone should have two bank accounts. The banks hated this, but regulations is regulations. Therefore, said banks made it nigh impossible to use their services, so people wouldn't run up costs.

What are the advantages of formal savings? We'll contrast them with their alternatives, such as ROSCA's, self-help groups, and bullocks.

ROSCA's are a strict cycle. People pool money together, which is then distributed to one person at a time in a set order. Self-help groups are similar to ROSCA's, since members still pool their money and that money is doled out at regularly scheduled intervals. The difference is that members can make requests for the money, as opposed to being next on the list, by paying interest.

Bullocks, or oxen, are neutered bulls that are effective draft animals. People observed that bullocks are always changing owners. At a distance, this makes little financial sense, since selling is expensive and time-consuming for the owners. Sure, bullocks have downtime, but why not just rent them?

It turns out that people use bullocks as savings. The same applies to bricks and housing, except these are less liquid than bullocks. Despite that, bullocks aren't entirely liquid, since their demand depends on rainfall and crop condition. When the crop is good, people have more money that they can then spend on bullocks -- which are expensive, since they're supply-constrained given that everyone is trying to buy them. Conversely, when shit's hit the fan, everyone tries to dump their assets and prices plummet. Thus, people buy when bull prices are high and sell when prices are low. The shared environment therefore produces a highly ineffective market.

Another instance of a shared environment hindering savings is the aforementioned self-help group schema. If you're borrowing from a group of people who are all subject to, say, the same microclimate as you, then your emergencies might be their emergencies. We lose together. The upshot here is that diversification is good. Formal institutions, such as banks, can offer that diversification since they're drawing from disparate demographics' savings.

Pascaline Dupas and Jonathan Robinson tested how opening bank accounts for savings-constrained Kenyan business owners affected their activities and expenditures. With a $7 opening fee, hefty withdrawal fees, and no interest, the accounts weren't particularly good. D&R randomly opened accounts for these business owners, who ended up more resilient to shocks and increased their business investments. Why is this, when there's no interest? D&R postulate this is because simply having a place to set away their money allows business owners to build a buffer against potential shocks. This is another benefit to formal institutions.

Yet, there are other forms of savings that people don't undertake. One example of savings is abstaining from using credit to buy from fruit or tea vendors in Chennai. These vendors charge 5% interest, which over time would compound substantially. Potential customers could opt to save by *not* spending some amount of what they buy with credit, therefore saving on that interest, effectively increasing their income. If they make a similar decision day after day, their income will have increased to the point that they don't need to spend or borrow nearly as much as they were at the beginning. So why don't they do this?

One possible explanation is that these customers don't understand compounding interest. Perhaps they have poor self-control, or discount the future too heavily. Professor Banerjee discounts this discounting theory, since if people were that impatient, we'd see that impatience manifest in some rather obvious ways across their lives; however, we don't see people just selling their houses and throwing end-of-the-world parties. People seem to behave as if their future matters. Other reasons include wanting to maintain their relationships with their vendors, lacking access to savings, or being involved in family conflict that undermines their saving.

One experiment attempts to ascertain what's really going on. This experiment buys out its participants' debts, then has these participants undergo financial literacy training. The hypotheses include potentially increased savings or at least a steady state of money sans shocks, or, if the issues are internal, such as with self-control, quick relapse into debt.

In both the Philippines and India, the training don't do squat. Or it does half-squat. About half the people plunge back into debt, but the others don't. Those that fall back into debt don't fall at rates that would suggest a 5% interest rate. Instead, it seems people stay at a certain amount of money until they fall into debt due to some circumstance or another, and then stay at that level of debt. This suggests impatience and an unwillingness to take advantage of compound interest.

If we're going to understand this impatience, we can begin to sketch the problem with hyperbolic discounting. $u(c_1) + \beta\delta u(c_2) + \beta\delta^2u(c_3) $, or $\max u(c_1) + \beta[u(c_2) + \delta u(c_3)]$.

$u(c_1)$ is how much we value today's consumption, $u(c_2)$ is how much we value tomorrow's, and $u(c_3)$ is how much we value the day after's. Each successive period is discounted by a constant $\beta$, and a power of $\delta$ that indicates how much less we value time further away from us.

In the sketch above, the individual values period 1 over period 2 by a factor of $\beta\delta$, and period 2 over period 3 by $\delta$. The issue, however, is that when they move into the future, suddenly "tomorrow" is now "today," and it's worth that much more. Their preferences are time *in*consistent. If this is the case, people will want to use commitment devices to tie their hands.

To test this, a Philippine microfinance institution offered savings accounts with built-in commitment features, meaning the clients can't withdraw (*Tying Odysseus to the Mast* by Ashraf et al.). The withdrawal mechanism is either time- or money-based, where in either case clients can withdraw once they've waited long enough or saved long enough. They were given the additional choice to place their savings in a lockbox that the bank had the key to. Participants' discount preferences were measured at baseline. The hypothesis is that hyperbolic discounters, or time inconsistent people, who are aware of their bias, demand commitment.

In the end, half of the people contributed to their accounts. Far more people chose the time goal than the amount goal, though those who chose the amount goal saved much more. No one tried to withdrsaw prematurely. Of these, do the hyperbolic discounters take up the commitment device? An indicator of hyperbolic discounting is whether the people reverse their preferences, i.e. choosing today over tomorrow, but the day-after-tomorrow over tomorrow. Preference reversal predicted commitment device takeup for women but not for men. When they commit, they save more.
