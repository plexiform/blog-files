My studying today was particularly ineffective, in large part I believe because yesterday was the first day in a long time that I'd dedicated that much energy and focus to studying. The other primary reason was that I was paralyzed from *fear* of the subject material at hand, terrified I was in over my head. I accomplished the brunt of my studying as the day came to a close, and only after I'd addressed my fears realistically:

    - What are the prerequisites for this course?
    - How far am I from gaining a sufficient understanding
      of said prerequisites? How many hours would it take?
    - How much of the course *actually* relies on this prereq?
    
   
   After checking reality against my panic, my fear that had paralyzed me for the majority of the day, I was invigorated. I stood a chance.
