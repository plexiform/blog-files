Hundreds of thousands of people in the WHO African Region die every year from Malaria. While this number is dropping precipitously, it's entirely unacceptable. Two thirds of the deaths are children under the age of 5.

Bed nets prevent mosquitos from transmitting but also from contracting the parasite to spread it. After around 50% of people protected from malaria, there's a steep payoff in that a group gains herd immunity.

Because of these positive externalities, some argue that government subsidies are the answer.
