When I was idling my time playing video games near a decaded, my attitude was one of self-assuredness should I choose to get my shit together. A couple of years after I began to get my shit together, my self-assuredness began to give way to  self-doubt and conformity. Suddenly it was about "catching up" and "fucking up." I wear cockiness well. I will get my "shit together." I'll be fine either way.
