So a major improvement I'd like to make in my workflow is to group my hours closer together to free up my evenings. I'm getting a late start today in no small part due to having studied to 1 AM last night and fallen asleep somewhere close to 3 AM.

More so than bundling my hours together, however, there's my wanting to experiment. I've thus far confined myself to a pomodoro-like workflow, complete with breaks, but have noticed the hours stretch longer when there are problems for me to solve (particularly in mathy areas) and that smaller chunks of time are insufficient. Now, I've not been bound to the pomo-y workflow, and in fact that's why I measure my time through emacs clocking instead of some strict countdown timer, so I'd like to start experimenting with creating larger, less structured blocks and seeing how that goes.

Today's late start is an opportunity for me to practice bunching things together as I've been wanting to and jumping in deeper without artificially imposed lines of when to jump subject to subject. This should serve me well in both understanding what works for me best as well as getting more done earlier in the day.
