How do we improve correlates to poverty, so as to improve their productivity and cognition and therefore their future poverty. Is there a behavioral poverty trap? This aligns very much with my interests.

Why do poor people make certain poor decisions? Intoxicants, investments, medical decisions, parenting?

One hypothesis as to why people make high-interest loans is because they're present-oriented and feel less impelled to delay gratification.

Perhaps they're poor as a *result* of their poor decisions. Perhaps their lack of education contributes to their poor decisions because they lack the knowledge and means to make good decisions. This could be a case of an omitted variable. Examples of omitted variables are effort, intelligence, mistakes, etc. These omitted variables can cause things such as low medical adherence.

What if it's a symptom of the environment or infrastructure? Lack of transportation, predatory lending, climates that lend to other factors that contribute to poverty such as poor land for agriculture and mosquitos for malaria.

Related to infrastructure issues, think *Nudge*-type institutional structures that take care of things people who aren't poor normally don't need to think about.

We begin with the hypothesis that poverty causes these behaviors.

**Mullainathan and Shafir: Scarcity.**

They hypothesize that scarcity automatically captures bandwidth. Cognitive load is compromised.

Because of this captured bandwidth, poor people make more rational financial decisions. However, this causes for a decrease in other cognitive tasks and decisions.

*Measuring Cognitive Function:*
[tie this into the "agile mind"]
- Inhibitory control
  - Selective attention, compartmentalization? Inhibitory control is known as the ability to override natural impulses.
  - There are two types of inhibitory control: interference control, which is cognitive control (watching where your attention goes, redirecting it), and behavioral inhibition, which is self-control (more in the physical space).
  - Measured using 3 tasks:
    - Simon task: only blue dot left, only green dot right. Have to override impulse to hit blue on the right or green on the left.
    - Hearts and Flowers task: Hit flower on the correct side, hit heart on opposite side.
    - Stroop task: Color names written out in colors different than their name. There are numeric versions (how often is the number 5 written out) and others.

- Attention:
  - Ability to focus on particular pieces of information. The ability to filter between what is relevant and irrelevant. There is simple and complex attention.
  - Tasks:
    - Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) measures simple attention. Millisecond counter moves up, press a button at a certain point. Goes on for 10 minutes. Good for measuring sleep deprivation.

- Working memory:
  - Ability to hold information in mind and juggle it
  - Drawing connections between seemingly unrelated things
  - reorganizing lists, doing mental arithmetic
  - Tasks:
    - Backwards-digit span: repeat items in reverse
    - Corsi block test: Which squares flashed? Left to right, right to left. These can measure both simple and working memory.

- Cognitive flexibility
  - Changing perspectives, thinking outside the box, adjust priorities
  - Tasks:
    - Task-switching and set-shifting tasks
    - Wisconsin Card sorting: How long does it take for you to detect a switch in sorting has occurred?


- Fluid intelligence
  - Problem solving, pattern recognition
  - Logical reasoning
  - Tasks:
    - Raven's progressive matrices

**Poverty impedes cognitive function Studies:**
*The Mall Study:*

Shoppers from New Jersey mall. Wide variety of incomes.

They're asked a question about money, then to think on it. They then perform RPM (Fluid intelligence) and Hearts&Flowers (executive function), then they answer questions.

Once they've been asked the questions, we compare the poor's performance on cognitive measures to the rich's.

The study doesn't deal with compartmentalization between thinking about the question and taking the test. It just attempts to capture the difference between the rich and poor here.

The poor, once asked about $1500 (the hard task), performed worse than the rich. They did just fine when asked the easy questions. This holds true for both cognitive control and fluid intelligence.

Was there external validity to this study? Do these conditions apply to poor countries, or persistent poverty?

Can we just assume poverty in reality reflects the artificial conditions of the mall study? That people are constantly thinking about money and therefore impaired. What if they just get used to it?

*The harvest study:*

It takes 18 months to grow sugarcane. They have to harvest over a 3-5 month period, since sugar mills are capacity constrained.

What if you compared people whose poverty levels change over time, depending on pre- or post-harvest? Pre-harvest, more outstanding loans, more belongings pawned, more difficulty dealing with bills.

We measure cognition through the numeric Stroop test and RPM.

Pre-harvest fluid intelligence is lower, errors are higher, response time is higher.

Does this affect their future poverty? Are they less productive?

*Odisha Study:*

Asked questions similar as in mall study. Given money and see how that affects their cognition.

Do we know for a fact these cognitive measures correlate with development measures?

**Time Preferences:**

Delayed gratification, cost and benefits, savings, etc.

What's our utility, negative or otherwise? How much do we care about the future? What weights do we put on it?

[Samuel's Discounted Utility]()
At each point in the future you discount that future period by delta, going to infinity in the future.

How do we figure out $\delta$? We observe a person's choices and determine the delta from that. Do they make the decision? Do they make it two days from now?

Asking people about hypothetical choices (Thaler, 1981), and what X makes them indifferent between some Y amount of money now, versus X a month from now, a year from now, a decade from now, etc.


When using Multiple Price Lists (MPL's), we observe the point at which people switch from option A to option B to observe their discount factor.

How do we determine that they care enough to answer honestly?

We can use a Random Lottery Incentive System (RLIS), in which case there is a random lottery since it might actually come true.

Now what's wrong with exponential discounting?

One is that people will weigh short-run outcomes very heavily such that longer-term options such as a year or two from now don't count for much anything. Another is credit card debt, where people really want money now. People also tend to splurge right after a payday.

The assumptions underlying the discounting model are extreme and unrealistic, when you begin to draw an indifference curve between now and some exponentially multiplied point further in the future. But people *do* care about the future. How do we account for that?

The evidence suggests more that while there is short-term impatience, people also care about the future.

Exponential discounting also assumes consistency in preferences and time (if someone makes plans now, they follow through accordingly in the future). It seems life is much more dynamically *in*consistent.

There's also evidence for there being a demand for commitment devices (e.g. Odysseus being tied to the ship against the threat of sirens). This wouldn't be the case if people had time consistent preferences.

*Quasi-hyperbolic Discounting:* [review this]

Adds a $\Beta$, which is the short-term discount factor, coefficient to the different periods of time, but the $\Beta$ gradually tapers off and doesn't apply to points in the future.

**review this discounting stuff**

*Social Preferences:*

How do we measure social preferences? To what extent do people care about each other, and why?

The Dictator Game: Make an allocational decision towards anonymous

The Trust Game: For each dollar you decide to give to the other person, we'll multiply it by some amount. Then the other person is made a dictator, and can decide how much of their money now they'll give back. This measures how much you give a fuck about the other, then how much you trust the other to reciprocate.

The Ultimatum Game: Someone is offered money and given the option to share, but there's a second person that is aware of the first's options, and can respond accordingly.

Experimental results show that people share 40-50% and these offers are accepted with increasing amounts of money. People tend to reject at around a 20% or under offer.

Americans donate 2% of their money to salaries.

Are people really that selfless, or is there some sort of norm or pressure that pushes people to donate? We can test this by doing anonymous testing. It turns out even anonymity doesn't erase altruistic attitudes, if they get a form of feedback.

**Measuring Learning:**

We want to measure participation, teacher effort, student enrollment, and academic achievement.

School enrollment has been improving over time - lots of progress from 2000 to 2015. However, attendance still lags behind. Participation has both its costs and benefits. School may be inconvenient or expensive to attend. Parents may underestimate the benefits of education (remember Duflo, ideas of linear returns to education). The future returns of education may be discounted too heavily. Even if the students are attending, they might not be learning. Only ~40% of 5th graders can read at a 2nd grade level. Pakistan and Uwezo are similar.

Flat learning trajectories far from match up with the trajectory expected of grades.

Historically, compared to the US's GDP/capita being similar as Sub-saharan Africa today (\$2500 in 1830, PPP-adjusted), things are better than expected. The US at the time was at 55% primary school enrollment, and 1% secondary school. A similar idea applies to health outcomes, in that poor countries can outperform similarly due to better overall health technologies.

Teacher absenteeism is huge. 27% of Ugandan teachers missing per day, 23% in India. Billions wasted. Even when they show up, teachers may be slacking. Many don't face the threat of being fired. A survey of 3000 Indian schools found only one teacher had been fired.

What do we do? Improve GDP/capita to improve learning? What about outliers such as Vietnam and Cuba, who have a great education relative to their GDP? Do these outliers represent their societal structure (communism)? What are they doing right even if we don't want to adopt those societal structures? What are cost effective ways to improve education?

*Measuring Outcomes in Education:*

What are our sources of data?

Administrative data is nice, as it may come straight out of the system (board of education, school). Primary data collection is also expensive, so if we have high quality administrative data, all the better. Trouble is that poorer countries might not have good admin data, or will fudge the data. This depends on the place.

There might be secondary survey data, like household surveys and the like.

Then there's primary data collection. This is good for when you wanna get down the specifics that apply to your outcome of interest.

We want to be able to *compare data and outcomes, especially in regards to cost effectiveness, across studies.* We use existing and validated measurements in regards to student learning and teacher efforts.

Validity means that the measurement measures what it purports to measure. Concurrent validity asks whether your measurement correlates well to other validated tests. Convergent-discriminant validity asks if your test aligns well with what you're interested in as opposed to some unrelated measure. Predictive validity is what it sounds like. This is most important. Since we can't jump into the future, we can compare the validity of a current test to proven predictively valid tests.

Reliability asks how consistent the results are and what the measurement error is. We check for test-retest reliability. How correlated are the measurements if you test twice?

*Student Participation:*

We use school data or household surveys to measure enrollment. Schools may inflate their enrollment which is why we may want to fall back on the latter. One reason for inflation is that schools may receive additional resources for higher percentages of enrollment and inflation.

A similar principal applies to measuring attendance, and we can also measure things like grain supply to the school or surprise checks by visiting the classes.

We can also compare potentially inflated data versus smaller sample, more expensive household surveys.

If we perform household surveys, we can ask specific questions about a child's attendance, say, over the last 5 days.

We want to always consider the tradeoffs involved in conducting a survey, in terms of costs effectiveness and also when considering avoiding biases as well as pissing people off.

*Teacher effort:*

We can first and foremost test if the teacher is attending school. This will often be administratively fudged. This means we want to usually directly observe what's up.

We then want to measure the quality of attending teachers' teaching. We can sit and observe, we can survey students and principals, or we can assess a teacher's knowledge using a test (this might antagonize teachers). This form of measurement is usually only warranted if we want to intervene on what a teacher does. These are usually pretty expensive.

To measure teacher attendance, we can log the roster of teachers and on some day check whether or not the teacher showed up, or ask the head-teacher about the teachers' attendance. It's important to note that head-teachers may use cellphones to lie by calling up a teacher and telling them to show up, so time and speed are of the esssence.

Classroom observation can be logistically difficult and expensive. There are, however, systemized ways of conducting them.

*Measuring Academic Achievement:*

Is the test context-appropriate? Are we measuring true learning outcomes as opposed to test-taking skills? Does the test measure what we're trying to improve? Does the intervention or test substitute away from some other useful concept or subject?

We want our test to capture a normal distribution in that we don't have ceiling or floor effects.

Dynamic comparability is we want the test to be applicable over time. Cross-sectional comparability is if we can move a student from one group to a larger one and see if the results apply there. Then benchmarking is just when we set a benchmark and compare the student's results relative to that benchmark.

*Designing Tests:*

We want enough variety in a test to capture a wide distribution of results. Remember that developing countries are not subject to the same expectations as those in an OECD country.

We also want to make sure each question matches to a specific domain or skill we're attempting to test. We can repeat questions across tests to allow for comparability.

To account for bias, we want context- and language-neutral tests of cognition.

**Gender:**

Are all views being represented? When we choose to interview a head of house, how does that affect or misrepresent someone else's point of view? There may be an information or misinformation barrier between genders.

Who's interviewing? The enumerator's gender may affect responses.

A program may have a total effect that doesn't tell the whole story. What if differences in gender treatment change differently than the total effect (women's vegetable gardens)?

Gender roles may be different. Additionally, measurement itself might be impacted by the gender -- time of day being interviewed, for example.
